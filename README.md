# Projet 2 Wild Code School

## Description

This was a project I've done with a team of 5 in the Wild Code School in Bordeaux, using the [simple MVC](https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/simple-mvc) provided by the school.


## Content

A web application of cheatsheets for developers, with different categories, identification process, storage in the database and so on.
Not a lot of budles were used, and we had to write all the mysql request by hand without doctrine, or check usernames and passwords manually for example.
It was very interesting working with agile methods and combining our efforts to make something very neat in only a couple of weeks, as no one in the project was a real developer before.
